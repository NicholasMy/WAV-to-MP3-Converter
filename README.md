# WAV to MP3 Converter
Converts WAV audio files to smaller MP3 audio files and removes the silence from the beginning and end of audio files.

Requires ffmpeg and pydub to run.

To use this tool, place it in a folder with ffmpeg and two child directories named "input" and "output". Place your wav files in the "input" folder, and run the program. This software will retain the folder structure of the input.
